Mean Filter: Each pixel value is replaced by the average of the values in its neighborhood. It's a simple filter that smooths the image. Median Filter: Each pixel value is replaced by the median of the values in its neighborhood. It is particularly effective for removing "salt-and-pepper" noise. Max Filter: Each pixel value is replaced by the maximum of the values in its neighborhood. It tends to highlight the brightest areas of the image.
